# AI Model Specifications


## Purpose

1. **energy_production_detection : ** The energy_production_detection AI model utilizes a limited dataset of 2000 lines to identify energy production events with an accuracy of 60%. Its primary objective is to assist in energy management and optimization by recognizing these events in real-world datasets. While the model demonstrates promising results, further improvements may be achieved with additional data and fine-tuning
## Key Features

- predict energy demand and energy production based on the weather and also equpment failer using sensors to detect failers before they accure 

## Technologies Used

- ML models **Sklearn**
